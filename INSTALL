Installation
============

1.) Build requirements
    ------------------

Currently only Linux is supported as a target platform.
Building the LZ4 filter plugin requires
.) cmake >= 2.6
.) hdf5  >= 1.8.11

and a recent gcc.

2.) Building and installing the plugin
    ----------------------------------

2.1.) Build on Linux
      --------------

The filter plugin uses cmake for building. Thus the recommended procedure for
building the code is to use an out-of-place build. 
After downloading the source code (either via a tarball or from git) create
somewhere a new directory 

$> mkdir lz4-build

and run cmake from within this directory, passing the path to the original
source directory as the first argument

$> cd lz4-build
$> cmake /PATH/TO/LZ4/SOURCES

Cmake will do all the configuration. Once the cmake run is finished a 

$> make 

and 

$> make install 

run will compile and install the filter plugin.

To use the filter for your own programs you may have to add the installation
directory of the plugin to the HDF5_PLUGIN_PATH.  

To modify the install directory use the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX for cmake

$> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

2.2.) Build on Windows
